# Build from Source
Some Arch Linux bash scripts to make custom binary from source code

[ffmpeg_full_ocheb](ffmpeg_full_ocheb) - lets you to build and use ffmpeg-full from AUR without bkeaking any default system dependencies. [There is a video demonstration of it](https://youtu.be/CYMWXSBstpI)

[get_ffmpeg-full_arch](get_ffmpeg-full_arch) - Semi-automatic script to download build and install ffmpeg-full (with support hw encoders) on arch linux 

get_last_vlc_arch - Semi-automatic script to download build and install vlc-git (4.0xx)

get_mpc-qt_arch - Semi-automatic script to download build and install mpc-qt (it's more for example of how to use some of my scripts in a build process than for actual use this software)
